# ELG3336_Self-Leveling-Glider
GOAL: To Develop a self-leveling glider. 

## Motivation
Initially part of our final project for ELG3336 at the University of Ottawa

## Progress
This project currently has two stages of development. In the first stage, PID controllers will allow the glider to self-level. In the second stage, the glider will be able to fly a set course using magnetometer and GPS data.

## Libraries
The following libraries were used in this project:
* For the IMU - https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050
* For the PID - https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library
